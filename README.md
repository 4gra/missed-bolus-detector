# missed-bolus-detector
Scours nightscout for possible missed boluses, and generates pushover warnings accordingly.

This is a long overdue hack to detect a fairly common pattern and cause of strife.  
Really this ought to be smarter, to detect IOB etc. but sometimes a thing just needs released at version 0.

And, why yes, it was an exercise in rapid machine-assisted prototyping, why do you ask?
I'm actually surprised how little it ended up contributing - but Blank Page Syndrome is real, and a LLM is a powerful rubber duck.
